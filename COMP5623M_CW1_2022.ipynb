    "### Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this coursework, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Practice building, evaluating, and finetuning a convolutional neural network on an image dataset from development to testing. \n",
    "> 2. Gain a deeper understanding of feature maps and filters by visualizing some from a pre-trained network. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and resources \n",
    "\n",
    "You must work using this provided template notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a GPU will speed up the training process, especially for Question 1.3. See the provided document on Minerva about setting up a working environment for various ways to access a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please implement the coursework using **Python and PyTorch**, and refer to the notebooks and exercises provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework will use a subset of images from Tiny ImageNet, which is a subset of the ImageNet dataset [https://image-net.org/]. Our subset of Tiny ImageNet contains 30 different categories, we will refer to it as TinyImageNet30. The training set has 450 resized images (64x64 pixels) for each category (13,500 images in total). You can download the training and test set from the Kaggle website:\n",

    ">[Private class Kaggle competition and data](https://www.kaggle.com/t/9b703e0d71824a658e186d5f69960e27)\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the dataset, you will need an account on the Kaggle website. Even if you have an existing Kaggle account, please carefully adhere to these instructions, or we may not be able to locate your entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Use your **university email** to register a new account.\n",
    "> 2. Set your **Kaggle account NAME** to your university username, for example, ``sc15jb``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class Kaggle competition also includes a blind test set, which will be used in Question 1 for evaluating your custom model's performance on a test set. The competition website will compute the test set accuracy, as well as position your model on the class leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Your completed Jupyter notebook file, without removing anything in the template, in **.ipynb format.**\n",
    "> 2. The **.html version** of your notebook; File > Download as > HTML (.html). Check that all cells have been run and all outputs (including all graphs you would like to be marked) displayed in the .html for marking.\n",

Hooks can be *forward* hooks or *backward* hooks; forward hooks are called with ```forward()``` and backward hooks with ```backward()```. In the model below, we register a forward hook that saves the **gradients of the activations** to the Tensor output of ```model.features```. The gradients are saved to a class variable so we can easily access them.\n",
